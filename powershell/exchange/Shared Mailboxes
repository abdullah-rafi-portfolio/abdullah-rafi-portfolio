How to Grant Access to a Shared Mailbox Using PowerShell

This guide covers how to grant users access to a shared mailbox in Exchange Online. It includes steps for granting read/manage access and full access permissions, along with troubleshooting tips for common issues.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following:

You have the required permissions to manage shared mailboxes.
The Exchange Online PowerShell module is installed on your machine.
The userâ€™s account is active and licensed for Microsoft 365.

Step 1. Connect to Exchange Online

Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@yourdomain.com

Step 2. Grant permissions

- Here is the command to grant Read permissions:

Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "shared@domain.com" `
    -User "user@domain.com" -AccessRights ReadPermission -InheritanceType All

- Here is how to grant Send As permissions:

Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "shared@domain.com" `
    -User "user@domain.com" -AccessRights SendAs -InheritanceType All

- Here is how to add FullAccess permissions:

# Grant Full Access
Add-MailboxPermission -Identity "shared@domain.com" `
    -User "user@domain.com" -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All

NOTE - FulLAccess is much more comprehensive than Read permissions - Here is a comparison of having Read & Send As, Vs. having FullAccess:

*Note: Send As must be granted separately for Full Access users if they need it.

Access can also be allocated via the Exchange Online portal, however this has only 2 options:

- Read and Manage - behaves as 'Full Access'
- Send As

For more granular control of permissions, using PowerShell is recommended.

Check Permissions in PowerShell

- Check Full Access permissions:

Get-MailboxPermission -Identity "shared@domain.com" | `
    Where-Object { $_.User -like "user@domain.com" }

- Check Send As permissions:

Get-MailboxPermission -Identity "shared@domain.com"

I will add the 'remove' commands once I have thoroughly tested them.
